## ABOUT THE PROJECT

  This project is an analysis of the data collected from the International Energy Agency examining the emission rates among developed countries. Specifically, this analysis looks at the G-7 countries,Russia, and the People’s Republic of China from 1991-2019. We looked at their annual emission rates and compared them to their annual gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita population. 
  
  The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not there is a positive relationship among a country and its annual greenhouse gas emission rates. We expected to find that those countries with a higher GDP would also have a larger share of annual greenhouse gas emissions.

<!-- QUESTIONS TO BE ANALYZED -->
## QUESTIONS TO BE ANALYZED

 - Which country produces the most amount of GHGs?
 - Which country produces the most amount of GHGs/capita?
 - What country produces the least amount of GHGs?
 - Which country produces the least amount of GHGs/capita?
 - In what year do we see a spike in GHG emissions? 
 - Is there a relationship between high GDP and greenhouse gas emissions?
 - Does the data reflect any difference in GHG emissions after a country has joined the Paris Agreement on climate?

## DATASET USING

  A CO2 emmision statistics package found on IEA (International Energy Agency) [website](https://www.iea.org/subscribe-to-data-services/co2-emissions-statistics) is used for this project. From the free highlights offered by IEA, we focused on the total CO2 emission section, the CO2 per capita section, and the CO2 per GDP secion.
