<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->  
## ABOUT THE PROJECT

  This is the a project . In this project, our team focus on nine countries, how their CO2 emission changes over time, and how the Paris Agreement change the trend. These nine countries are US, UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, France, China, and Russian Federation. Regarding time frame, we chose to use 1991 to 2019. 

<!-- QUESTIONS TO BE ANALYZED -->
## QUESTIONS TO BE ANALYZED

 - Which country produces the most amount of GHGs?
 - Which country produces the most amount of GHGs/capita?
 - What country produces the least amount of GHGs?
 - Which country produces the least amount of GHGs/capita?
 - In what year do we see a spike in GHG emissions? 
 - What is the median amount of GHGs produced by a country?
 - Is there a relationship between high GDP and greenhouse gas emissions?
 - Does the data reflect any difference in GHG emissions after a country has joined the Paris Agreement on climate?
 - What is the difference in the amount of GHGs produced by the biggest country and the smallest country?

## DATASET USING

  A CO2 emmision statistics package found on IEA (International Energy Agency) website is used for this project. From the free highlights offered by IEA, we focused on the total CO2 emission section, the CO2 per capita section, and the CO2 per GDP secion.
